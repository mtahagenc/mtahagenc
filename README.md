### Hi there I am Taha👋

My story is a little bit complicated. 
First thing first, I am a husband of a wonderful women an a dad of a precios daughter at age 1.
I graduated from Mining Engineering Faculty, started a job as a production engineer in a company and the company bankrupted lol. 
Then I established a jewelry store with my brothers and now we have two shops in different locations. 
And finally I am ready to pursue my dreams as an iOS developer that started back at university as a hobby.
